## Quick Start

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 soulteary/nginx-qrcode-server
```

open browser, visit `localhost:8080`

## Docker Images

Docker images that can be used:

- soulteary/nginx-qrcode-server
- soulteary/nginx-qrcode-server:memcached
- soulteary/nginx-qrcode-server:2022.08.21
- soulteary/nginx-qrcode-server:2022.08.21-memcached

## Docker Compose

If you have `compose` locally, you can also use the `docker compose` or `docker-compose` command to quickly start the service:


Simplify startup commands with compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Start the service with memcached for higher performance:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.memcached.yml up -d
```
